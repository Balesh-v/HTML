      <h1>HTML Styles Css</h1>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. <br />
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages
        all at once.
      </p>

      <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
        With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing
        between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what
        background images or background colors are to be used, different
        displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
      </p>

      <h2>Using CSS</h2>
      <p>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Inline - by using the <span>style</span> attribute inside HTML
          elements
        </li>
        <li>
          Internal - by using a <span>style</span> element in the
          <span>head</span> section
        </li>
        <li>
          External - by using a <span>link</span> element to link to an external
          CSS file
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,
        because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
        yourself.
      </p>

        <h2>Inline CSS</h2>

        <p>
          An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
          To use inline CSS, add the <span>style</span> attribute to the relevant
          element. The <span>style</span> attribute can contain any CSS property.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following example changes the color of a paragraph to red, and
          adds a blue background color:
        </p>
        <code>
          &lt;p style="color:red;background-color:blue;"&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
        </code>

        <p>
          The result of the above code will be a paragraph with red text on a
          blue background.
        </p>

        <h2>Internal CSS</h2>

        <p>
          An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page. To
          use internal CSS, add a <span>style</span> element in the
          <span>head</span> section of the page.

        </p>

        <p>
          The following example changes the text color of all paragraphs to red:
        </p>
        <code>
            &lt;style&gt;
            p { color: red; }
            &lt;/style&gt;
        </code>

        <p>
          The result of the above code will be that all paragraphs on the page
          will have red text.

        </p>
        <h2>External CSS</h2>

        <p>
          An external CSS is used to define a style for multiple HTML pages. To
          use external CSS, add a <span>link</span> element in the
          <span>head</span> section of the page.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following example links to an external CSS file called
          <span>style.css</span>:

        </p>
        <code>
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          The result of the above code will be that all styles defined in the
          <span>style.css</span> file will be applied to the HTML page.
        </p>

        <h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
        <p>
          A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block. The
          selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration
          block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by
          a colon. The property name is the style you want to change, and the
          value is the new value for that style.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following example changes the text color of all paragraphs to red
          and sets the font size to 20px:
        </p>
        <code>
            p {
                color: red;
                font-size: 20px;
            }
        </code>
        <p>
          The result of the above code will be that all paragraphs on the page
          will have red text and a font size of 20 pixels.
        </p>
        
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
