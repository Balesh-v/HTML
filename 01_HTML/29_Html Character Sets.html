        <h1>HTML Character Sets</h1>
        <p>HTML character sets are used to specify the set of characters that can be used in an HTML document. The most common character set used in HTML is UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters from different languages and scripts.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>UTF-8: This is the most widely used character set in HTML. It supports a wide range of characters, including letters, numbers, symbols, and emojis.</li>
            <li>ISO-8859-1: This character set is also known as Latin-1 and is used for Western European languages. It includes characters such as accented letters and special symbols.</li>
            <li>UTF-16: This character set is used for encoding characters in the Unicode standard. It supports a wide range of characters, including those from different languages and scripts.</li>
            <li>ASCII: This character set is a subset of UTF-8 and includes only basic English letters, numbers, and symbols. It is not suitable for documents that require characters from other languages.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To specify the character set for an HTML document, you can use the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document. For example, to specify UTF-8 as the character set, you can use the following code:</p>

        <pre></pre><code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>It is important to choose the appropriate character set for your HTML document to ensure that all characters are displayed correctly.</p>
