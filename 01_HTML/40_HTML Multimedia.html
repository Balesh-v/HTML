      <h2>What is Multimedia?</h2>
      <p>
        Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything
        you can hear or see, like images, music, sound, videos, records, films,
        animations, and more. Web pages often contain multimedia elements of
        different types and formats.

      <h2>Browser Support</h2>
      <p>
        The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single
        font in a single color. Later came browsers with support for colors,
        fonts, images, and multimedia!

      <h2>Multimedia Formats</h2>
      <p>
        Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files. The
        most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file
        extension. Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like:
        .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.
